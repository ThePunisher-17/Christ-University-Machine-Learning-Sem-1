converting  relevant 
continuous variables to discrete using binning. For example, you can group customers' ages into age 
categories. Moreover, create a heatmap for visualization, which will help us understand the correlation 
between variables and identify any potential multicollinearity.

V Check✔️
The churn dataset we have might suffer from class imbalance, where the number of customers who 
churned (Exited = 1) is significantly lower than those who did not churn (Exited = 0). This imbalance 
could lead to biased model performance and affect the churn prediction accuracy. 
To address this, I want you all to explore and implement techniques to handle imbalanced data. This 
might involve methods like: 
Resampling Techniques: Use techniques such as oversampling the minority class (churned customers) 
or undersampling the majority class (non-churned customers) to balance the class distribution. 
Synthetic Data Generation: Consider generating synthetic samples for the minority class using 
techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) or Adaptive Synthetic 
(ADASYN) to increase the representation of churned customers.

Remember to provide clear explanations and interpretations of the results in your 
final reports. Visualizations, graphs, and tables will be essential to support your analysis and make it 
easier for stakeholders to understand. Take your time, and let's meet again in a week to discuss your 
findings and insights. Good luck to a
