## Introduction

This repository showcases my work in the field of data science and machine learning. The projects range from exploratory data analysis to advanced algorithm implementation and comparison. Each project is housed in its own folder with a detailed explanation of the process, methods used, and results.

## Projects

### 1. Churn Dataset EDA
**Description:** This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into customer behavior and factors contributing to churn.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of customer demographics and churn rates
- Analysis of factors influencing churn

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Project Folder:** Churn Dataset EDA

### 2. EDA for Airline Customer Dataset
**Description:** This project focuses on performing EDA on an airline customer satisfaction dataset. The analysis aims to understand customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Visualization of customer satisfaction metrics
- Identification of key drivers of customer satisfaction

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Project Folder:** Airline Customer Dataset EDA

### 3. Market Basket Analysis using Apriori
**Description:** This project involves the implementation of the Apriori algorithm to perform market basket analysis on a grocery dataset. The goal is to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing to format the dataset for Apriori
- Implementation of the Apriori algorithm
- Visualization of frequent itemsets and association rules

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, mlxtend, Matplotlib

**Project Folder:** Market Basket Analysis using Apriori

### 4. Comparison of Apriori and FP-Growth using Threading
**Description:** This project compares the performance of the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms using multithreading. The comparison is based on execution time and the quality of the association rules generated.

**Key Features:**
- Implementation of both Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms
- Use of Python threading to run both algorithms concurrently
- Visualization of execution times and comparison of results

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, mlxtend, Matplotlib, threading

**Project Folder:** Comparison of Apriori and FP-Growth

### 5. Logistic Regression Implementation
**Description:** This project focuses on building a logistic regression model based on hospital data. The task was to classify whether a patient should be readmitted into the hospital or not.

**Key Features:**
- Excellent data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Feature selection based on the association of the independent variables with the target variable

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### 6. Decision Tree Implementation
**Description:** This project focuses on building a Decision Tree classification model based on data to determine whether an employee will stay or leave the company.

**Key Features:**
- Excellent data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Data imputation examples
- Data encoding with clean coding style
- Implementation of GridSearchCV, decision tree visualization, and evaluation metrics

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

### 7. Linear Regression Implementation
**Description:** This project focuses on building a linear regression model based on the insurance dataset. The task was to predict the insurance premium based on the factors.

**Key Features:**
- Encoding the categorical variables
- Scaling the values for better performance
- Evaluating the model using all possible measures
- Best visualization of predictions and residuals

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

## Setup

To run the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThePunisher-17/Christ-University-Machine-Learning-Sem-1/
    cd ML_labs
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each project folder contains its own set of instructions for running the code, typically through Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. Simply navigate to the desired project folder and run the provided code.
