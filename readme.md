Introduction
This repository showcases my work in the field of data science and machine learning. The projects range from exploratory data analysis to advanced algorithm implementation and comparison. Each project is housed in its own folder with a detailed explanation of the process, methods used, and results.

# Projects
## 1. Churn Dataset EDA
Description: This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into customer behavior and factors contributing to churn.
Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Visualization of customer demographics and churn rates
Analysis of factors influencing churn
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Project Folder: Churn Dataset EDA
## 2. EDA for Airline Customer Dataset
Description: This project focuses on performing EDA on an airline customer satisfaction dataset. The analysis aims to understand customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing and handling missing values
Visualization of customer satisfaction metrics
Identification of key drivers of customer satisfaction
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Project Folder: Airline Customer Dataset EDA
## 3. Market Basket Analysis using Apriori
Description: This project involves the implementation of the Apriori algorithm to perform market basket analysis on a grocery dataset. The goal is to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing to format the dataset for Apriori
Implementation of the Apriori algorithm
Visualization of frequent itemsets and association rules
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, mlxtend, Matplotlib
Project Folder: Market Basket Analysis using Apriori
## 4. Comparison of Apriori and FP-Growth using Threading
Description: This project compares the performance of the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms using multithreading. The comparison is based on execution time and the quality of the association rules generated.
Key Features:
Implementation of both Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms
Use of Python threading to run both algorithms concurrently
Visualization of execution times and comparison of results
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, mlxtend, Matplotlib, threading
Project Folder: Comparison of Apriori and FP-Growth
Setup
To run the projects in this repository, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ThePunisher-17/Christ-University-Machine-Learning-Sem-1/Lab [Lab no]
cd ML_labs
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)::
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages::
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Each project folder contains its own set of instructions for running the code, typically through Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. Simply navigate to the desired project folder and run the provided code.
